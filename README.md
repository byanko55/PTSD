## Where does happiness come from? Find true happiness
> **"Happiness occurs when we contribute our actions and lives to what we find ``meaningful``."**

<br>

Human beings want to find purpose and meaning in their lives. What is more realistic is that our purpose and what we find meaningful may not remain static all our lives. Theyâ€™ll grow and evolve as we do.

<br>

Here are the things that you can do here:
1. **Know what you want to be**
2. **Donâ€™t compare yourself to others**
3. **Choose goals according to your values in life and not othersâ€™ expectations**
4. Boosts yout self-confidence
5. Respect yourself and set boundaries with people when they cross them

<br>

We often struggle to put these wisdom into practice. Doing more of what you love will help bring more joy into your life. 

<br>

Unfortunately, there will always be things we donâ€™t enjoy doing but have to do. The trick is to limit these activities, and if we cannot do so, to take some major steps to change your situation may be necessary. 

<br>

Of course, these changes can be scary, but sometimes they are necessary to find true happiness. **Donâ€™t be afraid to make changes in your life if you feel they are necessary for your happiness.**

## Skills of a 'Peaceful'(~~Successful~~) Software Engineer

### 1. Your code doesn't need to be perfect
As a new engineer, you won't be expected to write elegant and beautiful code from the get-go. That's something that will take years of practice to master.

So don't worry too much about being perfect.

<br>

### 2. Writing Readable Code Is Essential
We, software engineers, spend much more time reading code than writing it.

A new software engineer must write code for humans, not machines. Get into the mindset of writing code humans can read because even though programming means giving instructions to computers, your present and future colleagues will interact with the code. Make it easy for your colleagues to read your code.

Follow your company's coding standards, indent your code, and give meaningful names to variables, methods, fields, classes and tests (yes, even tests need to be named appropriately).

<br>

### 3. Get Your Code to Work
When you're assigned a task, focus on writing working code.

You can think about the initial version of your code as a prototype.

You can (and you probably will) refactor and optimize your code later.

<br>

### 4. Try Not Over-Engineer
There is this ongoing saying that in software engineering, simple is best. For the majority of the time, I agree with this.

Over-engineering means creating complex solutions to simple problems. A great strategy to avoid over-engineering is to take a step back, think objectively about what you're doing and look at the bigger picture.

<br>

### 5. Learn How to Fix Bugs
Everyone hates bugs, but the reality is that we engineers are the ones to introduce them unintentionally.

An approach to deal with bugs is to use a Root Cause Analysis (RCA). When encountering a bug, you need to understand these three things:

1. Why is the bug happening?
2. How to solve the bug.
3. What you can do to prevent the same issue from happening again?
